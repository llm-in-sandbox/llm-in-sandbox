In $\triangle ABC$ points $D$ and $E$ lie on $\overline{AB}$ so that $AD < AE < AB$, while points $F$ and $G$ lie on $\overline{AC}$ so that $AF < AG < AC$. Suppose $AD = 4$, $DE = 16$, $EB = 8$, $AF = 13$, $FG = 52$, and $GC = 26$. Let $M$ be the reflection of $D$ through $F$, and let $N$ be the reflection of $G$ through $E$. The area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is $288$. Find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$.
