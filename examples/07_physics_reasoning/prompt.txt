An elastic spring with a spring constant of $k$ connects a block of mass $m$ to a wedge of mass $M$. The inclined plane of the wedge forms an angle $\alpha$ with the horizontal. The wedge slides on a horizontal plane, and all contact surfaces are frictionless. Given the original length of the spring is $d$, find the length of the spring $s_{0}$ when both the block and the wedge are at rest.
